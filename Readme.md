## Prerequisites

Before installing and running NetAdmin, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Python**: Version 3.6 or higher
- **nmap**: Network scanning tool

### Installing nmap

#### Windows

1. Download the [nmap installer](https://nmap.org/download.html) for Windows.
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
3. Ensure that the installation path (e.g., `C:\Program Files (x86)\Nmap`) is added to the system's PATH environment variable.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FabioHdez/netadmin.git
   cd netadmin
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


## Configuration

NetAdmin uses a `config.json` file to store configuration settings such as the IP range to scan and saved hosts.

### Initial Configuration

Upon the first run, if `config.json` does not exist or is empty, the application will prompt you to set the desired IP range in the format `xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/xx` (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`).

### Manually Editing `config.json`

The `config.json` file has the following structure:

```json
{
    "ip_range": "192.168.1.0/24",
    "saved_hosts": [
        {
            "ip": "192.168.1.10",
            "hostname": "Server01",
            "username": "admin"
        },
        {
            "ip": "192.168.1.15",
            "hostname": "Workstation01",
            "username": "user"
        }
    ]
}
```

- **ip_range**: Specifies the range of IP addresses to scan.
- **saved_hosts**: A list of hosts with their IP addresses, hostnames, and SSH usernames.

### Restoring Default Configuration

To reset the configuration to its default state:

1. Navigate to the main menu.
2. Select the **Restore to Default** option.
3. Confirm the action when prompted.

*Warning: This will erase all saved host configurations.*

## Usage

Run the NetAdmin script using Python:

```bash
python netadmin.py
```

### Main Menu

Upon launching, the main menu displays the following options:

```
NetAdmin v1.0           | Online Hosts: X
-----------------------------------------
1. View Hosts
2. SSH to Host
3. Ping Host
4. Add Host
5. Restore to Default
r. Refresh Hosts & Configuration
q. Exit
```

- **Online Hosts**: Shows the number of currently detected online hosts.


## Troubleshooting

- **No Hosts Found**
  - Ensure that the IP range in `config.json` is correct.
  - Verify that the devices you expect to see are powered on and connected to the network.
  - Check firewall settings that might block `nmap` scans.

- **nmap Not Found**
  - Ensure that `nmap` is installed on your system.
  - Verify that the `nmap` executable is added to your system's PATH.

- **Permission Issues**
  - Some `nmap` operations may require elevated privileges. Run the script with appropriate permissions if necessary.

- **SSH Connection Failures**
  - Confirm that SSH is enabled on the target host.
  - Verify that the correct username is provided.
  - Check network connectivity and firewall settings.
